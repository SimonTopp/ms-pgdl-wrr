  Data release: Process-guided deep learning predictions of lake water temperature

abstract: >-
  <p>Climate change has been shown to influence lake temperatures in different ways. To better understand the diversity of lake responses to climate change and give managers tools to manage individual lakes,
  we focused on improving prediction accuracy for daily water temperature profiles in 68 lakes in Minnesota and Wisconsin during 1980-2018.
  <br/>The data are organized into these items:</p><ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5d89d8e3e4b0c4f70d0ae4dc">Spatial data</a> - One shapefile of polygons for all 68 lakes in this study (.shp, .shx, .dbf, and .prj files)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5d8a2257e4b0c4f70d0ae513">Model configurations</a> - Model parameters and metadata used to configure models (1 JSON file, with metadata for each of 68 lakes, indexed by "site_id")</li>

  <p>******* UPDATE THIS****** This work was funded by the USGS Powell Center (Working Group title: "Continental-scale overview of stream primary productivity, its links to water quality, and consequences for aquatic carbon biogeochemistry"). Additional financial support came from the USGS NAWQA program and Office of Water Information. NSF grants DEB-1146283 and EF1442501 partially supported ROH. The USGS Wisconsin Modeling Center provided access to the HTCondor cluster for generating metabolism estimates.</p>
