  <p>Climate change has been shown to influence lake temperatures in different ways. To better understand the diversity of lake responses to climate change and give managers tools to manage individual lakes,
  we focused on improving prediction accuracy for daily water temperature profiles in 68 lakes in Minnesota and Wisconsin during 1980-2018.
  <br/>The data are organized into these items:</p><ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5d89d8e3e4b0c4f70d0ae4dc">Spatial data</a> - One shapefile of polygons for all 68 lakes in this study (.shp, .shx, .dbf, and .prj files)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5d8a2257e4b0c4f70d0ae513">Model configurations</a> - Model parameters and metadata used to configure models (1 JSON file, with metadata for each of 68 lakes, indexed by "site_id")</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5d89d90ce4b0c4f70d0ae4df">Model inputs</a> - Data formatted as model inputs for predicting temperature</li>
