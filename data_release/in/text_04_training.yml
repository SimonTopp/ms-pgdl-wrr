  Process-guided deep learning water temperature predictions: 4 Training data

abstract: >-
  This dataset includes compiled water temperature data from a variety of sources, including the Water Quality Portal (Read et al. 2017), the
  North Temperate Lakes Long-TERM Ecological Research Program (https://lter.limnology.wisc.edu/), the Minnesota department of Natural Resources,
  and the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (gleon.org). This dataset is part of a larger data release of lake temperature model inputs and outputs for 68 lakes in the U.S.
  states of Minnesota and Wisconsin (http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/P9AQPIVD).
