  All lakes historical training data: Process-guided deep learning predictions of lake water temperature


abstract: >-
  Observed water temperatures from 1980-2018 were compiled for 68 lakes in Minnesota and Wisconsin (USA). These data were used
  as training data for process-guided deep learning models and deep learning models, and calibration data for process-based models.
  The data are formatted as a single csv (comma separated values) file with attributes corresponding to the unique combination of
  lake identifier, time, and depth. Data came from a variety of sources, including the Water Quality Portal,
  the North Temperate Lakes Long-Term Ecological Research Project, and digitized temperature
  records from the MN Department of Natural Resources.
