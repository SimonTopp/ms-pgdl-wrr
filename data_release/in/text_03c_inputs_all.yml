  Process-guided deep learning water temperature predictions: 3c All lakes historical inputs

abstract: >-
  This dataset includes model inputs that describe weather conditions for the 68 lakes included in this study. Weather data comes from gridded estimates (Mitchell et al. 2004).
  There are two comma-separated files, one for weather data (one row per model timestep) and one for ice-flags, which are used by the process-guided deep learning model to
  determine whether to apply the energy conservation constraint (the constraint is not applied when the lake is presumed to be ice-covered).
  The ice-cover flag is a modeled output and therefore not a true measurement (see "Predictions" and "pb0" model type for the source of this prediction).
  This dataset is part of a larger data release of lake temperature model inputs and outputs for 68 lakes in the U.S.
  states of Minnesota and Wisconsin (http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/P9AQPIVD).

build-environment: Multiple computer systems were used to generate these data, including linux, OSX. The open source language R was used on all systems, as well as the open-source model GLM.

data-description: >-
  Drivers indexed by lake used to drive lake models. NLDAS drivers are contemporary (1980-2018) meterology. Each folder contains a driver for each study lake,
  and has identical attributes (described above). NLDAS drivers (68_lakes_meteo.zip) are described in
  Mitchell et al. 2004.
file-format: Separate comma-delimeted text files for each lake zipped into two files
